        <p> Hyaenidae (Hyena family): Hyenas are a distinct family within the order Carnivora, separate from the Canidae (dog family) and Felidae (cat family).</p>
        <p> Genus Crocuta: The spotted hyena is the only extant species in the Crocuta genus, which is believed to have diverged from other hyena lineages around 10 million years ago.</p>
        <p> Habitat: Spotted hyenas are found in various habitats across sub-Saharan Africa, including grasslands, savannas, semi-deserts, and even some mountainous regions.</p>
        <p> Social structure: Spotted hyenas are highly social animals, living in large clan groups with a complex hierarchical structure led by dominant females.</p>
        <p> Conservation status: The spotted hyena is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, but some populations are threatened by habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and persecution.</p>
        <p> Adaptations: Hyenas are known for their powerful jaws and bone-crushing teeth, which allow them to consume bones and tough animal matter. They also have excellent night vision and a strong sense of smell.</p>
